Feel free to skip this section if you are familiar with power markets design
as well as fundamental bottom-up power market modeling.

Wholesale power markets in Europe are organized as a sequential series
of markets from futures and forwards markets to short-term markets (spot markets).
Since futures and forwards markets mostly serve for hedging price risks of short-term
markets, we only focus on the spot markets which determine the actual operation
of plants and include a physical delivery of electricity to the system.

There are two kinds of spot markets, the day-ahead market as well as intraday
markets (auctions and continuous trading). We in turn focus on the day-ahead
market which is the most relevant one.

Our model in a way abstracts from the real market constellations and assumes
all plant operators to bid into the day-ahead market. We in turn do not explicitly
model power plant operators' (or other traders') bidding behaviour, but assume them to offer their
capacities at their marginal costs in a perfectly competitive
**quasi day-ahead market** in order
to serve an inflexible and exogenously given demand. We also include power storages and demand
response. The latter enables parts of the demand to adjust in a flexible manner.
Thus, the aggregated power plants capacities which are sorted by their marginal costs
result in a merit order that is similar to the aggregated supply curves in
the real day-ahead auction procedure in competitive power markets.

The perspective of our model is to assume that there is a "social planner"
optimizing the power system in terms of minimizing its overall (dispatch) costs
under the prevalent constraints, such as demand coverage or power plants capacity limits.
We assume this social planner to have **perfect** foresight over the entire
simulation time frame. We offer a :ref:`rolling-horizon` to break with
this assumption. Our basic approach is quite common
for **fundamental bottom-up modeling** of power systems
since using a sound model parameterization, it enables the modeler
to produce close to reality dispatch and price results in a highly
simplified modeling setting with quite large system boundaries.

What is more, is that power markets in Europe are **interconnected** and operated
within (mostly national) bidding zones. We model the German neighboring countries
and their power plants in a rather aggregated manner in order to improve our
day-ahead price prognosis and the dispatch result for Germany.

In order to improve our model results, we account for some **power system inflexibilities**
that lead to a deviation from the cost optimum and are expressed by introducing
additional constraints (such as minimum load profiles for CHP power plants
that are empirically derived to serve heat demands)
or adjusting parameter values (such as the overall
capacities of coal power plants that has not been fully made use of).

.. _granularity:

Model granularity
+++++++++++++++++

* Technical granularity:

For Germany, every **conventional block or power plant** is modelled individually,
whereas **storages** are aggregated to one cluster per technology.
**Renewable energy sources (RES)** units are clustered based on
their value applied from the market premium model leading to
roughly 20 units per technology as a default. For the neigbouring countries
which have interconnections with Germany, we consider one cluster per technology.

The following fuels and technologies are considered by default:

.. csv-table:: Renewable technologies
    :header: "fuel", "technologies"

    "Solar", "solar PV plants"
    "Wind onshore", "wind onshore plants"
    "Wind offshore", "wind offshore plants"
    "Run of River", "run of river plants"
    "Biomass", "solid biomass ST, biogas GT, biogas ST, biogas M"

.. csv-table:: Conventional / backup technologies
    :header: "fuel", "technologies"

    "Uranium", "Nuclear ST"
    "Lignite", "Lignite ST"
    "Hard coal", "Hard coal ST"
    "Natural gas", "Natural gas CC, natural gas GT, natural gas M"
    "Oil", "Oil CC, oil GT"
    "waste / mixed / other fossils", "other CC, other GT, other M"

All conventionals and backup plants as well as biomass plants may optionally
be combined heat and power (CHP) or industrial power plant (IPP). This
alters their minimum output profile.

.. csv-table:: Storage technologies
    :header: "energy source", "technologies"

    "electricity", "pumped hydro energy storage"
    "electricity", "reservoir energy storage"

Battery energy storage systems (BESS) are not yet considered since these are
mostly used for own consumption or provision of ancillary services and
not so much for arbitrage trading (as of now).
Since net network extraction as well as net feedin of
PV power plants are modelled, the BESS used for own consumption
in combination with PV are already taken care of.
Since the usage of BESS in the DA market is limited, their price effect is
(assumed to be) not very big. What is more, is that remaining system
is already parameterized to be quite flexible.

*Abbreviations:*

- BESS: battery energy storage systems
- CC: combined cycle (gas turbine)
- CHP: combined heat and power
- GT: gas turbine
- IPP: industry power plants
- M: combustion engine (German: "Motor")
- PV: photovoltaics
- RES: renewable energy sources
- ST: steam turbine

* Temporal granularity:

The default model resolution is **hourly** due to the resolution of the given
time series inputs, either as an integral optimization run for all hours of
a year (or another simulation time frame) or using a :ref:`rolling-horizon`.

* Spatial granularity:

There is one spatial node **per bidding zone for Germany and its 10 electric neighbours**,
thus representing real market area boundaries and processes without taking network congestions
within bidding zones into account.

The following countries and bidding zones are considered by default:

.. csv-table::
    :header: "country code", "country", "bidding zone(s)"

    "AT", "Austria", "AT"
    "BE", "Belgium", "BE"
    "CH", "Switzerland", "CH"
    "CZ", "Czech Republic", "CZ"
    "DE", "Germany", "DE-LU"
    "DK", "Denmark", "DK1, DK2"
    "FR", "France", "FR"
    "NL", "Netherlands", "NL"
    "NO", "Norway", "NO1, NO2, NO3, NO4, NO5"
    "PL", "Poland", "PL"
    "SE", "Sweden", "SE1, SE2, SE3, SE4"

.. _maths:

Mathematical background
+++++++++++++++++++++++
Feel free to skip this section if you are familiar with fundamental
bottom-up power market modeling using a linear programming approach.

From a mathematical point of view, our model is formulated as a linear program
with the following characteristics:

- goal: Minimize total power system costs
- constraints:
    - demand coverage
    - power plants constraints: capacity limits, ramping constraints
    - storage constraints: power limits, energy limits, storage losses, storage transition
    - demand response constraints: power limits, energy limits, time restrictions
    - constraints for interconnection: power limits, transmission losses
    - optional emissions constraint

Fixed time series, such as the demand time series or the fixed renewable infeed,
as well as scalar values we read in, are provided as parameters from a mathematical point of view.

Our model has a block-angular structure since the constraint formulations and
objective terms are encapsulated in the components definitions of oemof.solph.
Thus, in general decomposition techniques could be applied to speed up computation.

The model formulation ends in a sparse matrix. The complexity of the model is
determined by the :ref:`granularity` which may be altered. The model statistics
for the default granularity used are summarized in the table below
(48 hours simulation time frame):

======== =======
element  No.
======== =======
rows     93821
columns  129653
nonzeros 309613
======== =======

For the mathematical formulation, please see below.
You may also refer to the
`oemof.solph API reference <https://oemof-solph.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/oemof.solph.html>`_
for a documentation of the constraints and objective terms introduced
with the individual components.

.. _techs:

Technical background
++++++++++++++++++++
``pommesdispatch`` builds on the framework `oemof.solph <https://github.com/oemof/oemof-solph>`_
which allows to model energy systems in a graph-based representation
with the underlying mathematical constraints and objective function terms
implemented in `pyomo <https://pyomo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_.
Some of the required oemof.solph features - such as demand response modeling -
have been provided by the *POMMES* core developers which are also active in
the oemof community.
Users not familiar with oemof.solph may find further information
in the `oemof.solph documentation <https://oemof-solph.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readme.html>`_.

We use the following components from the ``oemof.solph`` framework in order
to represent the following units of the power system:

- Transformer: (conventional) power plants, renewable units for Germany in the
  market premium scheme, interconnetors to other bidding zones
- Source: commodity sources, fixed renewable units infeed
- Sink: national electricity demands
- GenericStorage: electricity storage units (pumped storage and reservoir)
- Buses: Elements to connect all power resp. energy flows

.. _rolling-horizon:

Rolling horizon approach
++++++++++++++++++++++++

A rolling horizon approach can be used for multiple use cases, e.g.

- to force a break with the perfect foresight paradigm and to model imperfect
  foresight
- to reduce model complexity and ensure model solvability.

The idea is to slice your overall optimization time frame
into shorter horizons and thus loose the perfect foresight assumption
as well as the global optimum over the entire simulation time frame.
In order to prevent storage units from being emptied at the end of each
time slice, an overlap should be defined. I.e., only parts of the next
time slice are used while the overlap is dropped.

The following figure explains the basic idea.

*Image based on Büllesbach (2018), p. 62 and Marquant et al. (2015), p. 2141*

The model results are then obtained by concatenating the results for the individual
time slices. There is a rolling horizon implementation integrated as an
alternative to a perfect foresight simulation in ``pommesdispatch``, see
:ref:`using`.
