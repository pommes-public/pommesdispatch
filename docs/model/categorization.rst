Model categorization
--------------------
The model in brief can be characterized as a **bottom-up electricity market optimization model**.
In the following, a model characterization based on Hall and Buckley (2016) is introduced:

Model purpose and structure

    "Purpose of the model", "| General: scenario analyses (forecasting)
    | Specific: power supply and power prices"
    "Structure of the model", "| Demand: exogenously (except for demand response)
    | Supply: RES exogenously; All other power sources endogenously optimized"
    "Geographical coverage", "| National: Federal Republic of Germany + imports / exports from
    | / to adjacent electric neighbors"
    "Sectoral coverage", "| Power market (effectively day-ahead) from a macroeconomic point of view
    | (no bidding simulation)"
    "Time horizon", "Short-term (<= 1 year)"
    "Time step", "Hourly"

    "Demand Characteristic Inclusion", "| Aggregated demand for Industry, Residential Sector, Commercial Sector
    | and Transportation"
    "Cost Inclusion", "Fuel prices, Operations and Maintenance Costs, CO2-costs"
